Data Source - Consumer CFPB inquiries and complaints DB, Reddit Finance Posts, Debt inquires, publically available hacked data from breaches 
Programming and Pre-processing - Python, Flask, Pandas, Numpy, spaCy, Jypter Notebook
ML- Scikit Learn, XGBoost
```

### Integration & Implementation:
```
Backend Relational DB - MySQL and CloudSQL for user info and store look up table
Dockerize & GCP container registry
GCP Deployment/Hosting/Endpoints
Kubeflow to manage distributed env 
```
### Operations and Monitoring
```
Monitoring and Visualization - Prometheus and Grafana, Pusher? []
Kubernetes for Distributed Computing
Kubeflow to manage distributed env 
AI Ethics - We do not calculate personal data in our recommendation engine to guard against bias
```
### Front-end: [Sarah]
```
-1st page that accepts user input and POSTs info to SQLite database 
-GETs output of ML and provides recommendations (min 3) to user
-Unit testing of code with [Ponicode](https://www.ponicode.com) AI tool and [standards](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/testing/) 
```

### ML pipeline in storage bucket for recommendation engine [Mani]
```
-Machine learning algorithms take numbers as inputs. This means that we will need to convert the texts into numerical vectors. There are two steps to creating the Document-Term Matrix:
Tokenization - with NLTK library (remove the punctuations, stopwords and normalize the corpus) basically divide texts into words or smaller sub-texts.
Vectorization - Tfidf vectorization increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the wordâ€¦in other words penalizes very frequently occurring words that provide less contextual meaning.
-topic tracking lightweight NLP model & continuous training
- Competitive classification models were explored 
Multiclass Logistic Regression
XGBoost
Linear Support Vector Classifier  
The Metrics for model evaluation -ROC_AUC, test accuracy, model run time, precision, recall for the 7 categories: credit card, digital card, credit repair, debt settlement, rewards credit card, secured credit card
-MLflow for model versioning
```   

### Monitoring [Daisy]
```
-Containerization and registry
-GCP Metrics for VM instance resource management displayed on Prometheus & Grafana 
-Web traffic monitoring
```
